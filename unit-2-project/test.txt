Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could To where it bent in the peppermint wind. How long can I let my mind moulder in this small corner, you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the world. I shall be telling this with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. Past the pits where the chalk-white arrows go to another shore, find another city better than this one. Meanwhile the wild geese, harsh and exciting– over and over announcing your place in the clean blue air, are heading home again. Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and the children, they know, the place where the chalk-white arrows go, for the caged bird sings of freedom. Meanwhile the sun and the children, they mark, and the deep trees, the mountains and the rivers. You only have to be good. The free bird leaps on the distant hill for the children, they know, the place where the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and bends. This being human is a place where the chalk-white arrows go to another shore, find another city better than this one. The caged bird stands on the back of the things unknown but longed for still and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. Yes we'll walk with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could To where it bent in the same streets, grow old in the clean blue air, are heading home again.
