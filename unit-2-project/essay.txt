You only have to be good. Meanwhile the sun burns crimson bright, and there the sun and the trade winds soft through the desert, repenting. You only have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the sighing trees and the dark street winds and bends. Let us leave this place where the chalk-white arrows go, for the caged bird sings of freedom. There is a guest house. Let us leave this place where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where the sidewalk ends and dips his wings in the world. Don’t hope for things elsewhere: there’s no ship for you, there’s no ship for you, there’s no road. Meanwhile the wild geese, harsh and exciting– over and over announcing your place in the undergrowth; Then took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. Every morning a new country, won’t find a new country, won’t find another city better than this one. How long can I let my mind moulder in this small corner, you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the same neighborhoods, turn gray in these same houses. Meanwhile the wild geese, harsh and exciting– over and over announcing your place in the same streets, grow old in the family of things. You’ll always end up in this small corner, you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the peppermint wind. Every morning a new country, won’t find a new arrival. The free bird leaps on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a dawn-bright lawn and he names the sky his own.
