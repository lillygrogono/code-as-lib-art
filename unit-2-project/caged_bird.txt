Autoplay









The free bird leapson the back of the windand floats downstreamtill the current endsand dips his wingsin the orange sun raysand dares to claim the sky. But a bird that stalksdown his narrow cagecan seldom see throughhis bars of ragehis wings are clipped andhis feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird singswith fearful trillof the things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hill for the caged birdsings of freedom The free bird thinks of another breezeand the trade winds soft through the sighing treesand the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawnand he names the sky his own. But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreamshis shadow shouts on a nightmare screamhis wings are clipped and his feet are tiedso he opens his throat to sing The caged bird singswith a fearful trillof things unknownbut longed for stilland his tune is heardon the distant hillfor the caged birdsings of freedom.

COMMENTS OF THE POEM











Hebert Logerie Sr.

                    Maya, You are now a Free Bird

African  Queen, Afro-American Queen, 
American Queen, Black Queen, 
You are now free, you have escaped, 
You are now crowned, phenomenally draped, 
And beautifully coiffed as a famous Poet, 
Great Lecturer, Mother, Lover, Activist, 
Fighter, Doctor, Nurturer, Philanthropist, 
Philosopher, Engineer of rhymes, and Architect
Of simple, complicated and powerful words, 
Those are as sharp as our ancestors’ swords.

You had everything that an amazing woman
Wanted to possess: pride, confidence, elegance, 
Style, bravery, wit, intelligence, humility and patience.
You inspired kings, queens, intellectuals and laymen.
You were, without a doubt, a phenomenal woman, 
A special woman that men and women admired.
You feared nobody: the racist, the confused, and the liar.
You feared nothing: weather, water, sand, soil and fire.
However, you loved everybody: the sick, the weak, and the tired; 
The poor, the homeless, the brave, and the strong.
Maya, you are now a free bird, please sing the song.
You have opened the cage, like a bird, you are now free.
Spread your wings to shower the world with wisdom, 
Love, passion, comprehension, tolerance and liberty.
Hum again and sing again the beautiful song of freedom.
African  Queen, Afro-American Queen, 
American Queen, Black Queen, 
You have left a phenomenal legacy, 
You will be remembered until eternity.

                                SCHADE! The great poetess just died on the 28th May 2014 and you wrote this after that day, so very pity, I have known her personally and have met her in the USA, she IS a very loving person and with so much humor

                                Only such a beautiful comment could do justice to such a subject.

                    You will forever be remembered. A caged bird that lies 6feet but still sings a shrill song. The sky is yours to claim.

                    This poem has been my all-time favorite. It was the way she and all her people felt and faced the discrimination of blacks and whites.
