The Guest House

Autoplay









This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.

                    It is so nice and thoughtful of the ph team to select Rumi as the poet of the day. And the best poem they have selected from his treasures to host here. Charming.

Be grateful for whoever comes, 
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond. 

Typical of the Great Mowlana Jalaluddin Rumi. Immensely happy that his poems are on ph forever to read and re-read!

                    This is a beautiful teaching from Mewlana. Akin to teachings in Jungian psychology of embracing all aspects of yourself. Thank you.

                    Life explained so simply yet deeply by Rumi... hallmarks of a classical great that he was.  Enjoyed the verses thoroughly.

                    It is interesting to know how a personality develops as well as how it influences the way people around think and behave. The body is the house of the soul.  In ''De Anima'', Aristotle wrote, “whether all affections are common to what has the soul or whether there is some affection peculiar to the soul itself.” - Wonderful poem- voted 10.
