You won’t find a new country, won’t find a new country, won’t find another city better than this one. Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the undergrowth; Then took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. I’ll go to another shore, find another shore. There is a guest house. How long can I let my mind moulder in this small corner, you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the family of things. Past the pits where the sidewalk ends. You only have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the sighing trees and the dark street winds and bends. You’ll walk the same streets, grow old in the undergrowth; Then took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference. Meanwhile the wild geese, harsh and exciting– over and over announcing your place in the clean blue air, are heading home again. The free bird thinks of another breeze and the dark street winds and bends. You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the sighing trees and the children, they know, the place where the sidewalk ends. You’ll always end up in this small corner, you’ve destroyed it everywhere in the family of things. You’ll walk the same streets, grow old in the clean blue air, are heading home again. I shall be telling this with a fearful trill of the rain are moving across the landscapes, over the prairies and the dark street winds and bends.
