## create a directory with an assortment of images that can be used for the sky (birds, sun/moon, clouds)
## create a directory with an assortment of images that can be used for the middle ground (hills, grass, sand)
## create a directory with an assortment of images that can be used for the foreground (trees, cacti, animals)
## not sure what the code for this is but I want to figure out how I can randomly pull an image from each directory to layer on top of eachother and create a surrealist-looking landscape
## I might also think about a command where I can change the colors/ images from daytime to nightime.. again not sure how to do that
